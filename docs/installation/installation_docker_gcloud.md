4. In the search bar above on console page, enter 'Compute Engine' and click on ```Compute Engine```. 


5. If you have not activated billing for compute engine, click enable billing and choose your account to activate your Compute Engine. Your Google Compute Engine should be activated within a few minutes.


6. Click ```Create instance``` to create an instance. In machine type, choose ```small(1 shared vCPU)```.
	Choose whatever zone you like.
 
	In Boot Disk, choose ```Ubuntu 14.04```, and the disk size should be larger than 40GB.
	On the bottom of the page, click ```Management, disk, networking, access & security options``` to show more options. Inside of this, click into the tab ```Networking``` and choose ```New static IP``` instead of ```Ephemeral```. Enter a name for your IP. Google will assign a IP for you.
	Check the two boxes ```Allow HTTP traffic``` and ```Allow HTTPS traffic```. Finally, click ```Create``` to create an instance. Wait a few minutes for the creation to complete.


7. Once the creation has finished, click ssh below to establish web ssh connections.

8. In the Web Console, enter:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get -y install docker.io
sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
sudo docker build https://github.com/loklak/loklak_server.git
```

Once finished, the last line will provide the image ID, like ```Successfully built 4e11208a7b34```. Copy or remember this id, we will need this id to tag the image.
Tag your image by entering ```sudo docker tag YOUR_IMAGE_ID loklak```. In my case, we enter ```sudo docker tag 4e11208a7b34 loklak```
Run our server by entering:
```
sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 loklak
```
Enter your assigned IP address into your browser to check if it is working.
